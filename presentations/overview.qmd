# Getting Started with Required Software

## Install R

Please install R (version: R-4.2.1) from: [https://cran.r-project.org/](The%20Comprehensive%20R%20Archive%20Network)

![](images/paste-51CD4F9D.png){width="553"}

## Install RStudio

Please install RStudio desktop from: [Latest RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

![](images/RStudioWeb-min-01.png){width="528"}

# Getting Started with RStudio

## Clone ITHIM-R repo

Please clone <https://github.com/ITHIM/ITHIM-R.git>(https://github.com/ITHIM/ITHIM-R.git) via RStudio

::: callout-note
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
:::

## Open the project

Please open the When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Depended packages

Before we start building and installing the **ithim-r** package, we need to install two packages. One is the **remotes** package. Please install using:

```{r, size="large"}
#| eval: false
install.packages("remotes")
```

Once that is done, please install and load the Dose-Response for Physical Activity **drpa** package by:

```{r, size="large"}
#| eval: false
remotes::install_github("meta-analyses/drpa")
library(drpa)

# install other depended libraries
install.packages(c("plyr", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr", "haven", "ggplot2", "plotly", "ReIns", "truncnorm", "distr", "pracma", "data.table", "stringr", "summarytools", "gt", "flextable"))
```

## Install the package

Depending on the Operating System, please build and reload the ithim-r package using keyword shortcuts below:

## Data Structure

## Load package

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Load the package
library(ithimr)
# and other useful ones
library(tidyverse)

io <- readRDS("../results/multi_city/io.rds")

city <- 'sao_paulo'

```

## Trip Dataset (1/2)

A single-day travel diary in which each row represents a trip

-   **Individual-level variables**

    -   **participant_id**: unique ID for each individual
    -   **age**: participant's age as an integer
    -   **sex**: male or female

-   **Trip-level variables:**

    -   **trip_id**: unique ID for each trip made by each individual
    -   **trip_mode**: main mode of the trip
    -   **trip_distance**: total trip distance in kilometers

## Trip dataset (2/2)

-   **Stage-level variables:**
    -   **stage_mode**: Mode of the trip stage
    -   **stage_duration**: Duration of each stage in minutes

```{r}
#| echo: false
io[[city]]$trip_scen_sets |> filter(scenario == "Baseline") |> dplyr::select(-scenario) |> arrange(trip_id) |> head() |> knitr::kable()

```

## Road Traffic Injury (RTI) Dataset

This dataset comes from police records. We are only looking at fatalities and ignore injuries in our model. It is usually in a matrix form with rows representing strike mode, and column representing casualty mode. However sometimes you have multiple years of annual data - that needs to be weighted, and with additional info such as casualty age and gender. We are using long format taking into account as much data as possible.

-   **Injury data**

    -   **event_id**: unique ID (integer) for the incidence
    -   **year**: collection year - could have multiple years data
    -   **cas_gender**: male or female (gender of the victim)
    -   **cas_age**: victim's age
    -   **cas_mode**: transport mode of the victim
    -   **strike_mode:** transport mode of the striker

```{r}
#| echo: false

PATH_TO_LOCAL_DATA <<- file.path(find.package('ithimr',lib.loc=.libPaths()), 'extdata/local',city)
filename <- paste0(PATH_TO_LOCAL_DATA, "/injuries_", city, ".csv")
injuries <- readr::read_csv(filename, col_types = cols())

knitr::kable(injuries |> rename(event_id = X1) |> dplyr::select(event_id, year, cas_gender, cas_age, cas_mode, strike_mode) |> head())

```

## Physical Activity (PA) Dataset

This dataset generally comes from a PA travel survey - which is processed. It has information of weekly Leisure Time PA for each of the participant.

-   **PA survey**

    -   **participant_id**: unique person ID (integer)
    -   **age**: numeric age
    -   **sex**: male or female
    -   **ltpa_marg_met:** leisure-time (non-transport) physical activity in marginal metabolic equivalent task hours (mMET-hrs) per week

```{r, results='asis'}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(io[[city]]$synth_pop |> rename(ltpa_marg_met = work_ltpa_marg_met) |> arrange(participant_id) |> head())
```

## Burden of Disease (BoD) dataset (1/2)

Cause specific disease burden data from Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation **IHME's** global burden of disease database (<https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019>)

-   **Burden data**

    -   **measure**: Deaths or Years of Life Lost (YLLs)
    -   **age**: age group - usually a five year band as integer
    -   **cause**: cause/disease (*details later on*)
    -   **population**: population size by age and gender group
    -   **mix_age**: minimum age in integer for the current age and gender group
    -   **max_age**: maximum age in integer for the current age and gender group
    -   **rate**: rate of risk of measure per person
    -   **burden**: burden of the measure for the *population*

## Burden of Disease (BoD) dataset (2/2)

```{r, results='asis'}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(io[[city]]$disease_burden |> head())
```

## Population Dataset

The demographic information is by age and gender. This also comes from **IHME's** global burden of disease database (<https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019>)

-   **Population**

    -   **sex**: male or female
    -   **age**: age group - usually a five year band as integer
    -   **population**: population size

```{r, results='asis'}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(io[[city]]$demographic |> head())
```
