# Application of ITHIM-R

## Load package

Please make sure that the ithim-r package is installed on your computer: [https://cran.r-project.org/](The%20Comprehensive%20R%20Archive%20Network)

![](images/paste-F7C7570F.png)

or you can try this command:

```{r}
library(ithimr)
```

## Select case study

Open `multi_city_script.R` from the files section, and please make sure that the `sao_paulo` is selected in the `cities` variable. Also please make sure the city and global parameters are set to be read and loaded, like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Specify list of cities. We are only using SP for now.
cities <- 'sao_paulo'

# Specify parameters file for SP specific and global vars
input_parameter_file <- "InputParameters_v18.0.xlsx"

# Read in all params through this script
#source("helpful_scripts/load_input_params.R")
```

# What-if Scenarios

We created four scenarios where each mode is increased by `5%`. The four scenarios are: cycle, car, bus and motorcycle scenarios where in each case, we increase their share of trips by `5%` each. Table below shows `trip proportion` for `Sao Paulo`.

| Travel mode | BASELINE | Cycle Scenario | Car Scenario | Bus Scenario | Motorcycle Scenario |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| car         | *33.0*   | 31.2           | **38.0**     | 28.8         | 31.0                |
| motorcycle  | *2.3*    | 2.2            | 2.1          | 2.0          | **7.3**             |
| bus         | *18.6*   | 17.5           | 16.2         | **23.6**     | 17.3                |
| cycle       | *1.0*    | **6.0**        | 0.9          | 0.9          | 1.0                 |

# Cause/disease Table

Table of the considered causes/diseases. `1` in the cell below represents whether the cause/disease has an effect on the pathway. If there is `1` on both `PA` and `AP` pathways, we multiply their `Relative Risks` to capture the interaction.

# Cause/disease level

We are operating at three difference levels of causes/diseases:
